# Agora
Agora is an online platform where users can make posts of various advertisements/posts that they see online which they believe makes a statement that can be Agreed or Disagreed with. Agora aims at maximizing a clear discourse between Agreeing, Disagreeing, and Neutral sides of the statements made by sources of media (Image/Video). With this goal in mind, we decided to create the web application Agora.
